Fun and interactive user experience

How to Use 🚀
Run the script in a Python environment (Python 3.x recommended)

Enter your first number when prompted

Enter your second number when prompted

See the results of all four operations displayed!

Example Usage 💻
text
Enter the first number: 10
Enter the second number: 2

Results of your two numbers:
Sum: 12.0
Difference: 8.0

Notes ⚠️
The calculator currently doesn't handle division by zero gracefully (it will crash if you try to divide by zero)

All inputs are converted to floats to handle decimal numbers

The program is designed to be simple and fun - perfect for beginners!

Future Improvements 🔮
Add error handling for division by zero

Include more operations (exponents, modulus, etc.)

Create a graphical user interface (GUI) version

Add history functionality to remember previous calculations
